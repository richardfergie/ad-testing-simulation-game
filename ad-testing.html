    <h1>Ad Testing</h1>
    <p>Below is a simple game in which your objective is to get the best overall click through rate.</p>
    <p>The game is kind of "turn based" with each turn lasting a week.</p>
    <p>When setting up for your turn you can add new adverts and pause or reactivate old adverts. You can also choose "rotate evenly" or "optimise for..." ad serving settings. The meaning of these corresponds to the AdWords equivalent.</p>
    <p>You may also want to change the number of weekly impressions for the ad group. This setting is adjustable because a good strategy for a low traffic ad group might not be the same as a good strategy for a high traffic ad group.</p>
    <p>Click "New Advert" to get started and then when you are ready for the first week click "Run".</p>
    <p>You can choose to play against some computer controlled competitors. At the moment there are only three different strategies they can use:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Cheater</em>: This competitor knows the true CTR of each ad so they always pick the right winner. They run two ads at a time for a week and then pause the worst one and create a new advert. You will have to be lucky to beat this guy, but there are a few things you can do to tilt the odds in your favour.</li>
            <li><em>Random</em>: This guy runs two ads at a time for a week and then pauses a random ad before creating a new advert. You should be able to beat the computer here in the long run, but remember that they might be lucky in the short term.</li>
            <li><em>Always Add</em>: Every week add a new advert. Adverts are never paused, instead the computer relies on the "optimise for clicks" setting to make sure the best adverts are shown the most.</li>
        </ul>
